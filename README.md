# SRPN 

This is my first princpiples of program coursework  where I had to replicate closely the functionalities of the SRPN.

SRPN is a Reverse Polistion Notation calculator which has a unique feature: saturated arithmetic. In saturated arithmetic, calculations remain at the maximum value when they exceed the limit, thus preventing overflow.


## Key Features:


```bash
RPN Logic: Expressions are entered in postfix notation.
```
```bash
Saturated Arithmetic: Prevents overflow by capping results at the maximum value.
```

```bash
Testing: Four categories of tests to ensure accurate functionality:
-> Single operations
-> Multiple operations
-> Saturation
-> Obscure functionality
```
